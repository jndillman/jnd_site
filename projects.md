# Building a Compiler

Before building a compiler, I start with building an interpreter that takes data from a file by parsing it and then performing lexical analysis to build a tree of commands. The interpreter is written in the Go programming language. This functionality will be expanded to become a compiler. The language is called Monkey, a toy language with C-like syntax.

# Levitating Record Player

This project aims to build a record player in which the vinyl record will sit on a platter that is levitated and rotated through the air at the speed necessary to play an LP record. This project uses a control system to take data from a series of hall sensors and then outputs a PWM signal to some h-bridges which power electromagnets that rotate the record.

# Cmoy Headphone Amplifier

This project builds a portable, headphone amplifier that gets power from a 9 volt battery. The headphone amp comes with a gain control knob and fits within an altoid can that can be used as the case. The headphone amp is a class D type amplifier and can be used to improve the listening quality on any headphones taking an audio input.
