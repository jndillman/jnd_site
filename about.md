I am a fifth-year student at the Pennsylvania State University studying Electrical Engineering. I have previously worked for the university as a researcher studying propagation through networks. During this time, I coauthored a graduate level paper title ‘On Propagation of Phenomena in Interdependent Networks.’ I currently work at different auditoriums around the University Park campus including the Bryce Jordan Center, Eisenhower Auditorium, Schwab Auditorium, and Esber Recital Hall.


I would like to work in the field of computer science as a programmer, especially as security expert in the private sector. I have taken courses on operating systems and would like to work on this low-level type of security. I also have an interest in the areas of digital signal processing. Eventually, I would like to get a Masters degree in computer science studying computer security. If I were to do work on the hardware side, I would specialize in power electronics. Specifically, I would work with converters and inverters.


Through my time studying engineering I have learned many things. For programming, I am well versed in programming in Python, C++, and C. These languages are instrumental in helping me build projects and learn data structures and algorithms. I have also learned how to use MATLAB and R for mathematical and statistical analysis. In my computer engineering classes I learned how to use hardware design languages such as Verilog and VHDL. In addition, I have experience working in multiple 3d CAD programs such as Solidworks, Sketchup, and Revit. I also have experience building both analog and digital circuits. This includes experience using basic electronics equipment such as variable power supplies, multimeters, and oscilloscopes. I also have worked with several different microcontrollers including everything from Arduinos to PIC controllers.


Outside of work I have a number of different hobbies. I enjoy assisting theatrical productions with lighting and sound work. I also enjoy reading science fiction novels and also books on astronomy. I like to play board games such as chess and go and was even the president of the chess club during my senior year of high school. I sail boats and was part of the of the sailing club during college. I even competed for Penn State against other schools in regattas. Finally, I enjoy skiing which is an activity I’ve enjoyed with my whole family since I was a kid. I have travelled to many different mountains to ski and have been as far as Lake Tahoe, CA to go skiing. My favorite mountain is Squaw Valley, USA.
